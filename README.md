IPP Everywhere™ v1.1 Printer Self-Certification Tools
=====================================================

The IPP Everywhere™ Printer self-certification tools are used to test the
conformance of printers to PWG Candidate Standard 5100.14-20xx: IPP Everywhere™
v1.1. The testing and submission procedures are defined in PWG Candidate
Standard 5100.20-20xx: IPP Everywhere™ v1.1 Printer Self-Certification Manual.

The [IPP Everywhere™ home page](http://www.pwg.org/ipp/everywhere.html) provides
access to all information relevant to IPP Everywhere™. Sample PWG Raster files
(needed for the document tests) can be downloaded from the PWG FTP server at
<https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/ipp/examples> - only the files dated on or after
June 7th, 2018 can be used.

The "ippeveselfcert@pwg.org" mailing list is used to discuss IPP Everywhere
Printer Self-Certification. You can subscribe at

> Note: Tests are intended to be run on an isolated network, or at least when no
> other users are printing using the target printer.  Otherwise the test scripts
> will fail randomly.
